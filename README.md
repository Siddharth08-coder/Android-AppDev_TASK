*Task 4*: 
Deadline: Monday, 10 May 2021

Use the following api to fetch the details of dog breed and display it in the app. Use your own
creativity for the User Interface.

API GET
https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all

https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{breed_name}/images/random

The first url gives you the list of all the breeds of the dog. After fetching this, you need
to fetch the specific image for the dog and use Glide/Picassso to view in it into the
ImageView. Fetch and Cache the data in the phone which will not require any other
assistance of the database and will just require internet for gliding the image in the
imageview. Use the retrofit library for calling the API.


*NOTE:* None of the task is sole creation/production of Siddharth, he has used multiple libraries and sources available over the internet including GitHub, 
StackoverFlow, Udemy and YouTube.
